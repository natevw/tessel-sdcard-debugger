# tessel-sdcard-debugger

This dumps some debugging info if you have trouble using volumes with the [sdcard](https://github.com/tessel/sdcard) module.

To use, your Tessel should be plugged in and ready with your SD card plugged into Port A:

```
git clone https://github.com/natevw/tessel-sdcard-debugger
cd tessel-sdcard-debugger
npm install
tessel run card_debug.js
```
